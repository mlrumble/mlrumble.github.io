# Install Solr Server on your Laptop
I am using a Mac so the simplest way I could do that is by using

```bash
# Install Solr Server
brew install solr
# Start Solr Server
solr start
# Install solr for Python
pip install solrpy
```

Running the command `solr start` gives us this message:

`
Waiting up to 180 seconds to see Solr running on port 8983 [\]
Started Solr server on port 8983 (pid=93066). Happy searching!
